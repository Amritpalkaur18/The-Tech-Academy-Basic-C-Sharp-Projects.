# The Tech Academy Basic C-Sharp Projects

Welcome to my repository for the Basic C-Sharp Projects course at The Tech Academy. This repository will include all of my coding assignments and projects completed as part of the course.

Each project will have its own directory with relevant code, documentation, and any notes about the assignment. This repository serves as a portfolio of my progress and learning throughout the course.

I will update this repository regularly with new projects and revisions as I advance through the coursework. Feel free to explore and review my work.
